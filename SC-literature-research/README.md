Datafile: 
- scopus.csv the file created using Scopus database, containing titles of existing research papers with abstracts and keywords. Please find the Scopus query in scopus_query.txt
- other datasets are created within this Quantlet, so please just use the codes in the order listed in Quantlet Scripts Description

Additional Notes: 
- you would need to create additional folder images
- be aware of the redundancies in the code. The code presented here is not made for production (neither it is optimized for production). It's purpose is solely to see and to be able to compare all the numbers presented in the paper
