Datafile: 
- open_source_parsed_16thousand.csv the file created in the Quantlet SC_open_source_scraping

Additional Notes: 
- you would need to create additional folder images
- be aware of the redundancies in the code. The code presented here is not made for production (neither it is optimized for production). It's purpose is solely to see and to be able to compare all the numbers presented in the paper
