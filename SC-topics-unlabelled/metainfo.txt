Name of Quantlet: 'SC_topics_unlabelled'

Published in: 'Understanding Smart Contracts: Hype or Hope?'

Description: 'This Quantlet is dedicated to clustering of the unlabelled open source Ethereum Smart Contracts.
First, we encode our abstracts with Distilbert embeddings and using UMAP we reduce dimensionality reduction to perform K-Means, finally again using UMAP
reduce dimensionality to 2, to be able to plot it.'

Additional Notes:
- you would need to create additional folder images
- be aware of the redundancies in the code. The code presented here is not made for production (neither it is optimized for production). It's purpose is solely to see and to be able to compare all the numbers presented in the paper
