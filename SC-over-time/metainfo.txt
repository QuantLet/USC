Datafile:
- contracts_over_time_2020-12-09.csv the file created using BigQuery on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/bigquery/ethereum-blockchain https://www.kaggle.com/lizzzi1/contracts-over-time (the notebooks can also be found here, but the application requires the Ethereum BigQuery dataset on Kaggle)
- transactions_over_time_2020-12-09.csv the file created using BigQuery on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/lizzzi1/transactions-over-time
- source_codes_from_dapps.csv the file created within SC_Dapp_scraping quanlet

Additional Notes:
- you will need to create the additional data folder and store the first two datafiles there
- be aware of the redundancies in the code. The code presented here is not made for production (neither it is optimized for production). It's purpose is solely to see and to be able to compare all the numbers presented in the paper
